====== Web interface ======

===== Help / Dokuwiki shows "Forbidden" =====

**I cannot access the help pages or the notepad (the Dokuwiki content), and get a "Forbidden" message.**

You need to configure your web server to allow access from other hosts on the network to the Dokuwiki content. It is often restricted, by default, to local users only.

===== How can I restrict access to IVRE's Web interface =====

**I want to prevent unauthorized access to IVRE's results.**

First, you have to configure your web server to authenticate remote users. The most important, of course, is to protect access to CGI files (the static files are publicly available and do not contain any result).

In an AD or Kerberos environment for example, Apache can be configured to provide SSO authentication.

Then, if you want to restrict access to the results based on the user login or domain, you can add the following lines to ''%%/etc/ivre.conf%%'':

<code>
WEB_DEFAULT_INIT_QUERY = 'noaccess'
WEB_INIT_QUERIES = {
    'admin@SUBNETWORK.NETWORK.AD': 'category:SubNetwork',
    '@ADMIN.NETWORK.AD': 'full',
}
</code>
By default, users won't have access to any result. The user ''%%admin@SUBNETWORK.NETWORK.AD%%'' will have access to the results in the category ''%%SubNetwork%%''. The users in the ''%%ADMIN.NETWORK.AD%%'' realm will have access to all the results.
