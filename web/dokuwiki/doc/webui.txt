====== Introduction ======

[[doc:README|IVRE]] (Instrument de veille sur les réseaux extérieurs) or DRUNK (Dynamic Recon of UNKnown networks) is a network recon framework, including two modules for passive recon (one p0f-base and one bro-based) and one module for active recon (mostly nmap-based, with a bit of zmap).

This web interface presents results of (Nmap) active scans that can be filtered with keywords (and, for some of them, shortcuts are available in the menus).

Keep in mind that the information available in this interface highly depends on the options used to run Nmap.

====== The interface ======

===== The top navigation bar =====

It contains several elements; from left to right:

  * A shortcut to the start page, that cleans every keyword.
  * A button to display this help page.
  * Some menus with shortcuts to add filtering, sort or display commands.
  * Some links to "share" (export) the current page.

===== The left side bar =====

The first part allows to navigate within the results. Be careful with the last button that goes to the last result page, as it can be very slow when a lot of results are available.

The progress bar shows where the currently displayed results are within the whole results set.

The second part allows to add, modify or remove filter, sort or display commands.

The second part allows to explore the results by generating graphs displayed in the rightest part of the screen.

  * The first field displays a graph with the 15 most common values of a variable in the filtered results. This can be slow when the number of results to scan is important. Here is a list of (sometimes) interesting values to try here:
    * ''%%category%%'', ''%%source%%''
    * ''%%country%%'', ''%%city%%'', ''%%as%%''
    * ''%%domains%%'', ''%%domains:[level]%%''
    * ''%%hop%%'', ''%%hop:[number]%%''
    * ''%%port%%'', ''%%port:[open/closed/filtered]%%'',  ''%%portlist:[open/closed/filtered]%%''
    * ''%%service%%'', ''%%service:[port]%%'', ''%%probedservice%%'',  ''%%probedservice:[port]%%'', ''%%product%%'', ''%%product:[port]%%'',  ''%%version%%'', ''%%version:[port]%%''
    * ''%%devicetype%%'', ''%%devicetype:[port]%%''
    * ''%%ports.scripts.id%%'', ''%%scripts.id%%''
    * ''%%script:[scriptname]%%'', ''%%portscript:[scriptname]%%'' (like ''%%port:%%''),  ''%%hostscript:[scriptname]%%''
    * ''%%smb.os%%'', ''%%smb.lanmanager%%'', ''%%smb.domain%%'', ''%%smb.dnsdomain%%'',  ''%%smb.forest%%'', ''%%smb.workgroup%%''
    * ''%%cert.issuer%%'', ''%%cert.subject%%''
    * ''%%modbus.deviceid%%'', ''%%enip.vendor%%'', ''%%enip.product%%'', ''%%enip.serial%%'',  ''%%enip.devtype%%'', ''%%enip.prodcode%%'', ''%%enip.rev%%'', ''%%enip.ip%%''
  * The //Address space// button displays a graphical representation of the filtered addresses. The abscissa axis represents the two high bytes (or the three when the results belong to the same /16 network), and the ordinate axis represents the two low bytes (or the low byte).
  * The //Map// button displays the locations of the results on a world map.
  * The //Timeline// and //Timeline 24h// buttons display time-lines where the abscissa axis represents the time and the ordinate axis represents the IP addresses.

===== Scan results =====

Ten results (maximum) are displayed per page by default.

Each result has its own frame. In the default display mode, it displays a summary for the host. Long-clicking a result frame toggles between the summary display and the full display for the result.

The pencil icon in the upper-right corner opens the notepad page for the current host (see below) in the rightest part of the screen.

Each blue element in the results can be clicked to add a filter.

====== Available commands ======

===== Command specification =====

The commands might require a parameter, provided after the colon sign ''%%:%%''. Some commands can be used negatively, by prefixing them with ''%%!%%'' or ''%%-%%''.

The commands can be entered in the input boxes in the second part of the left side bar or added by clicking on a shortcut in the top bar menus.

In the following list, a ''%%[!]%%'' before the command shows it can be used negatively, and a ''%%:%%'' after the command indicates it requires a parameter.

When a parameter is required the full value must be specified, or when appropriate, a regular expression can be used, with the ''%%/[expression]/[flags]%%'' syntax (e.g.: ''%%hostscript:smb-enum-shares:/WRITE/%%'').

If your command includes spaces, you need to protect it by using single or double quotes.

===== Commands list =====

==== Filters ====

  * ''%%[!]archives%%'' show results from the archives database (and ''%%!archives%%'' has no effect since it is the default behavior).
  * ''%%[!]host:[IP address]%%'' filter a specific IP address. Using the IP address directly (without ''%%host:%%'') is equivalent.
  * ''%%[!]net:[IP address/netmask]%%'' filter a specific network (CIDR notation). Using the CIDR notation directly (without net:`) is equivalent.
  * ''%%[!]category:%%'' filter a category.
  * ''%%[!]country:[two letters code]%%'' filter a country.
  * ''%%[!]city:%%'' filter a city (use with ''%%country:%%'').
  * ''%%[!]source:%%'' filter a source (specify the source name).
  * ''%%[!]timeago:%%'' filter recent enough results; the value can be specified in seconds or with the appropriate suffix in minutes (''%%m%%''), hours (''%%h%%''), days (''%%d%%'') or years (''%%y%%'').
  * ''%%service:[expression]%%'', ''%%service:[expression]:[port number]%%'' look for an expression in the name of a service.
  * ''%%product:[service]:[product]%%'', ''%%product:[service]:[product]:[port number]%%'' look for a product.
  * ''%%version:[service]:[product]:[version]%%'', ''%%product:[service]:[product]:[version]:[port number]%%'' look for a specific version of a product.
  * ''%%banner:%%'' look for a specific banner of a service.
  * ''%%script:[scriptid]%%'', ''%%script:[scriptid]:[output]%%'' look for a specific (port) script.

  * ''%%os:%%'' look for a specific value in the OS discovery results.
  * ''%%anonftp%%'' filter results with anonymous FTP allowed.
  * ''%%authhttp%%'' look for HTTP servers with authentication and a default (e.g., ''%%admin%%''/''%%admin%%'') login/password working. The Nmap script seems to get a lot a false positives.

  * ''%%skip:[count]%%'' skip ''%%count%%'' first results.
